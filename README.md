## Overview

The Order Summary Card challenge on Frontend Mentor is designed to enhance your coding skills by building a realistic project. In this challenge, the goal is to create a responsive order summary card that users can interact with. The card should provide key information about an order, and users should be able to see hover states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** For the structure of the order summary card, I used semantic HTML5 markup to ensure a clear and meaningful document structure.
- **CSS custom properties:** To enhance maintainability and ease of styling, I leveraged CSS custom properties (variables) for defining colors, spacing, and other reusable values. This allowed for easy global changes and improved consistency throughout the stylesheet.
- **CSS Grid:**I incorporated CSS Grid for certain layout elements, particularly for aligning the pricing details. CSS Grid was instrumental in creating a two-dimensional layout with precise control over rows and columns.
- **Mobile-first workflow:** Following a mobile-first approach, I initially styled the order summary card for smaller screens. As I expanded the viewport, I applied media queries to adapt the layout and styles for larger screens, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of the Order Summary Card solution, I encountered various challenges and valuable learning opportunities:

- **Responsive Design Mastery:** I deepened my skills in creating responsive designs that seamlessly adapt to different viewport sizes. Ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience across various devices became a primary focus.

- **Efficient Image Optimization:** Exploring techniques for optimizing images, especially for the order summary card, allowed me to strike a balance between visual clarity and efficient loading times. This optimization contributes to a smoother user experience.
- **Typography Enhancement with Google Fonts:** Experimenting with different font combinations from Google Fonts became an integral part of enhancing the overall design. This exploration aimed at finding the perfect balance between readability and aesthetic appeal.

- **HTML and CSS Best Practices:**Applying and reinforcing HTML and CSS best practices became a cornerstone of the project. This included leveraging semantic HTML markup, adhering to proper naming conventions, and crafting clean, modular CSS code for maintainability.

- **Design Consistency Focus:** Maintaining a cohesive design language throughout the Order Summary Card solution was a key objective. This involved establishing and adhering to a professional and visually pleasing aesthetic, ensuring a unified user experience.

### Continued development

In my journey of developing the Order Summary Card solution, I've identified areas for ongoing improvement and expansion:

- **Accessibility Improvements:** Deepen understanding and implement accessibility principles for a more inclusive user experience.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques:** Continue exploring and implementing advanced CSS techniques for modern and appealing designs.
- **Collaborative Development:** Learn and apply version control (Git/GitHub) for streamlined collaboration and efficient code management.
